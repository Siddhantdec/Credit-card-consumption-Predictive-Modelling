# Credit-card-consumption-Predictive-Modelling
Understanding the consumption pattern for credit cards at an indivisual customer level for customer relationship management. This project has been build to study the relationship between the characteristics of the consumers and their consumption patterns.
Predicting the credit consumption for the months July, August and September based on the data based on the data given for April, May and June.
Validating the model using the Room Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE) between the predicted credit card consumption and the actual given consumption.
Expected Outputs:
1) Detailed Code with comments.
2) Data Exploratory Analysis
3) Model Validation outputs
4) Model documentation with all the details.
5) Predicted values for the customers where target variable having missing values.
